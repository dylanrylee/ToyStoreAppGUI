# Assignment 3
GUI Toy Store Company App

- When a toy is purchased, the number of stock for that toy decreases
- When you add a toy, a serial number is required and depending on that serial number, a specific toy type 
  is created
- When you remove a toy, the serial number inputted has to be exact, and when it is exact, it removes
  it completely from the database, making it unable to search for it when you input the name/serial number/toy type of the 
  toy
